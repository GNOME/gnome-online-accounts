Overview of changes in 3.5.3
============================

* Facebook is enabled by default

* Microsoft Exchange is enabled by default

* The AddAccount method exposed by org.gnome.OnlineAccounts.Manager now
  requires a new argument of type a{sv}. This is an API break, but no one
  should be calling it apart from the backend code implementing
  goa_provider_add_account. This was necessary to ensure that the credentials
  are stored in the keyring within the AddAccount method to avoid a race
  between the "account-added" signal being emitted and the credentials being
  actually store.

* Methods to directly interact with the keyring are no longer exported as
  public API. These were only meant to be used from within the backend and the
  daemon and were never meant to be used from applications.

* Updated translations:
 Greek
