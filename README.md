# GNOME Online Accounts
Single sign-on framework for GNOME

GNOME Online Accounts is a single sign-on framework for GNOME. It aims to
provide a way for users to setup online accounts to be used by the core
system and core applications only. Calendar entries show up in GNOME Shell,
e-mail in Evolution, online storages are exposed as GVolumes, and so on.
